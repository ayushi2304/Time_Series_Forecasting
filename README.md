Following data collection, various statistical techniques, including simple moving averages, weighted moving averages, least squares, simple exponential smoothing, Holt's method, Holt-Winters method, and ARIMA, were employed to mitigate the impact of time series components, such as trend, seasonality, cyclical variations, and irregularities.
